## ❓ Questions Before We Proceed

1. **Timeline**: Do you want me to do the full redesign now, or phase it?
2. **Images**: Should I use placeholder images from Unsplash, or do you have specific images?
3. **Dashboard**: Keep dashboard dark (easier to read data) or make it light too?
4. **Priorities**: Which pages are most important to redesign first?

## 🚀 Ready to Start

I've already:
✅ Updated the global color scheme
✅ Changed layout to use light background

Next steps depend on your preference. I can either:
1. **Go all-in**: Redesign everything now (4-6 hours of work)
2. **Start with home**: Focus on home page + header/footer first
3. **Phased approach**: Do one section at a time

**What would you like me to do?**
